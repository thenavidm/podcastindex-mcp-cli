/**
 * Turning a failure into something the caller can act on.
 *
 * Every message here is written for a model that cannot see the code, cannot
 * see the config, and gets exactly one line to decide whether to retry, retry
 * differently, or stop and tell the user something.
 *
 * The case this file exists for is Podcast Index answering 401. That single
 * status covers four completely different problems: no credential configured,
 * a wrong key, a wrong secret, and a machine whose clock has drifted outside
 * the three minute signing window. They are indistinguishable from the response
 * body, and the last one is both the most common in practice and the only one
 * nobody guesses. So the 401 message names all four in the order worth checking
 * and points at `doctor`, rather than saying "unauthorized" and leaving someone
 * to regenerate a key that was fine.
