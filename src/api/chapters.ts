/**
 * Chapters, the other thing the API only points at.
 *
 * The Podcasting 2.0 <podcast:chapters> tag gives a URL to a JSON file the
 * publisher hosts. Podcast Index passes the URL through and never fetches it,
 * so a chapter list is one more thing that exists in principle and is
 * unreadable in practice until something goes and gets it.
 *
 * Chapters are worth the trip because they are the publisher's own table of
 * contents. They say what an episode covers and when, which answers "is this
 * episode about the thing I care about" far more cheaply than reading a
 * transcript, and they carry the links a host promised in the show notes.
 *
 * The format is stable and small, so this is mostly validation. The one real
 * decision is `toc`: the spec lets a publisher mark a chapter as not belonging
 * in a table of contents, which is how sponsor reads are usually flagged. They
 * are kept, and labeled, rather than dropped, because "where are the ads"
 * is a legitimate question and silently removing them would make the timeline
 * lie about what is in the episode.
