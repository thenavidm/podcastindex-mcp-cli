/**
 * The one HTTP path every network call goes through, and the request signing.
 *
 * **Signing.** Podcast Index authenticates each request on its own rather than
 * with a session. Three headers travel together: the key, a unix timestamp, and
 * a SHA-1 of the key, the secret and that timestamp concatenated in that order,
 * lower-case hex. The secret itself is never transmitted.
 *
 * **The timestamp is the trap.** The server accepts roughly a three minute
 * window either side of its own clock. A laptop that slept through a timezone
 * change, a container with no NTP, or a VM restored from a snapshot will fail
 * every single call with a 401 that is indistinguishable from a wrong key. So
 * this client records the server's own `Date` header on every response and
 * exposes the drift, which is what lets `doctor` say "your clock is 4 minutes
 * fast" instead of "unauthorized".
 *
 * **Two surfaces, deliberately separate.** `request` talks to Podcast Index
 * with credentials. `fetchFile` fetches a transcript or a chapter file from
 * whatever host the podcaster put it on. Those hosts are arbitrary, unvetted,
 * frequently slow, and occasionally serve a 200 MB file where a transcript was
 * promised. Folding them into one client would mean either signing requests to
 * strangers, which leaks nothing but is sloppy, or giving Podcast Index the
 * loose limits an unknown host needs. So they are separate methods with
 * separate deadlines and a size cap on the one that needs it.
 *
 * `fetchImpl` is injectable so tests exercise all of this without a network.
 * A test that needs the internet is a test nobody runs.
