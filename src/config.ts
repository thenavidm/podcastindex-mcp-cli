/**
 * Settings, and the three surfaces this server reaches.
 *
 * Podcast Index looks like one API and is really three things with different
 * requirements, which is why this file is shaped the way it is:
 *
 *   1. the signed API        api.podcastindex.org/api/1.0, needs a key and a
 *                            secret, and signs every single request
 *   2. the open endpoints    hub/pubnotify and the static data files, which
 *                            take no credential at all
 *   3. the open web          transcript and chapter files, which live on the
 *                            podcaster's own host and not on Podcast Index
 *
 * The third one is the reason this server is worth more than a thin wrapper.
 * The API answers most interesting questions with a URL, and a URL is a dead
 * end for a model that cannot open it. Fetching those files is a different kind
 * of request against hosts nobody vetted, so it is a separate surface with its
 * own timeout and its own size cap rather than being folded into the API client.
 *
 * The one setting worth understanding is the clock. Every signed request
 * carries a timestamp and Podcast Index accepts a three minute window either
 * side of its own. A machine with a drifting clock fails every call with an
 * authentication error that reads exactly like a wrong key, which sends people
 * off to regenerate a credential that was never the problem. `doctor` checks
 * for it by name.
