/**
 * Reading what an episode actually contains.
 *
 * This is the group the server exists for. Every other tool in here answers a
 * question about metadata: who published it, when, how often, under what
 * category. These answer what was said.
 *
 * Podcast Index will tell you a transcript exists and hand you a URL. It will
 * not fetch it, and a URL is a dead end for a model, so the useful half of the
 * Podcasting 2.0 spec sits one step out of reach behind every plain wrapper.
 * These tools take that step: fetch the file from the publisher's host, work
 * out what format it really is, and return timestamped text.
 *
 * Two design decisions worth stating.
 *
 * **A full transcript is not returned by default.** A two hour episode is
 * roughly 120,000 characters, which is more context than almost any question
 * about it is worth. `get_transcript` returns a bounded window and says how
 * much is left, and `search_transcript` exists so that the common question,
 * "where did they talk about X", never needs the whole thing at all.
 *
 * **Failures here are ordinary, not exceptional.** These files live on the
 * publisher's own host. They 404, they move, they serve HTML error pages, and
 * they time out. That is the normal weather, so every error says whose fault it
 * is: a dead transcript URL is the podcaster's host being down, not Podcast
 * Index being wrong and not a bad call.
