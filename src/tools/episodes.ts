/**
 * Episodes: a show's back catalog, and one episode in detail.

 * The same one-tool-many-endpoints choice as `get_podcast`, for the same
 * reason. What is specific here is `since`, which is the difference between
 * pulling forty episodes to find the three published this week and asking for
 * the three. Negative values are read as "seconds ago", because a model
 * computing a unix timestamp from a relative date gets it wrong often enough
 * to matter.
