/**
 * The three tools that change something, and why only two of them ask.
 *
 * `notify_feed_update` tells the index a feed has new content so it recrawls
 * sooner. It is idempotent, it needs no credential, and the worst outcome of a
 * careless call is one unnecessary HTTP request by a crawler that was going to
 * come anyway. Guarding it would teach a model to pass `confirm` reflexively,
 * which would then be passed on the two tools where it matters.
 *
 * `submit_feed` and `submit_feed_by_itunes_id` add a podcast to a public global
 * directory that hundreds of apps read, and **this API has no way to remove
 * one**. Undoing a mistake means asking the people who run Podcast Index. That
 * asymmetry is the entire reason those two require confirmation and the first
 * one does not.
 *
 * Both submits also need a key with write permission, which Podcast Index
 * grants separately. A key without it gets a 403, mapped in `api/errors.ts` to
 * a message saying exactly that, so a permission problem never reads as a bug.
