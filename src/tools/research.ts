/**
 * Tools shaped like the question rather than like the API.
 *
 * Everything else in this server maps roughly one tool to one endpoint. These
 * three do not, and they exist because the questions people actually bring are
 * not endpoint-shaped.
 *
 * "Tell me about this show" is five calls: the feed, its episodes, its value
 * block, its crawl health, its people. A model asked to do that either makes
 * five round trips or, more often, makes one and answers from a third of the
 * picture. Fanning out once and returning a brief is both faster and more
 * accurate.
 *
 * "Where has this guest been" is worse. The person endpoint returns episodes in
 * no useful order, repeats shows, and mixes a host's own show in with guest
 * appearances, which is the opposite of what somebody researching a guest
 * wants. Grouping and sorting that is real work and it should not be the
 * caller's.
